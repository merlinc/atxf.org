  <h1>The Gumby Report - 9 April 1996</h1>
  
  <b>By Matt Curr</b>
  <pre>The Inaugural Gumby Awards
  **********************************
  
  [lights fade,  screen brightens, run clip]
  
  Harry looked around one last time. He'd gotten to know his surroundings
  quite well, even began to like them after all this time. But it was time
  for a change, he didn't know why, there was just some deep yearning within
  his being that cried out to him in the darkness. It was time. Harry had put
  it off long enough, the time for the great journey was at hand.
  
  Harry had always known he was different, the strange appendages that had
  grown by his side were only a small indication of this. The others had made
  fun of him, declared him an outsider and shunned him as best they could.
  But none of that mattered anymore. It was time.
  
  He moved slowly towards the surface, excited by the prospect of satisfying
  the urge he had felt since day one. As he crossed the frontier he was
  blinded by the light , bright yet warm. His eyes quickly sought to rectify
  the situation and finally images started appearing before him. He moved
  forward, unhindered by the dry land, his appendages carrying him up the
  gentle slope.
  
  That was when he noticed the corpse before him. So he wasn't the first.
  Someone else had tried to cross the frontier. It filled him with a sense of
  hope, for the first time in his life Harry felt as if he wasn't alone. But
  this feeling was quickly replaced by one of dread. If this was what
  happened to his predecessor, what would happen to him? Harry tried to force
  it out of his mind, yet it continued to pester him. What right had he to
  venture out this far, maybe he SHOULD turn back. There was a status quo
  here, one that had to be maintained. But Harry was sick of being
  stereotyped, his life was here, on dry land.
  
  Harry glanced back at the primordial ooze with a sense of longing, but with
  the feeling of dry earth beneath his feet he wandered along. Life wasn't
  that bad as an amphibian. A bit lonely, but pretty cool nonetheless.
  Besides he was amphibious, if it got too bad he could always go back and
  visit.

  ****************************
  
  Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen to the Inaugural Gumby Awards. We have quite a
  line-up in store for you tonight. Not the least will be a female
  African-American making politically incorrect jokes, and hey we may even
  get some of the more lame members of this newsgroup to come out on stage
  and receive pompous tributes and the token standing ovation. I'm sure we
  can trot Lyndal out in a wheelchair, man, it'll be a barrel of laughs.
  
  Now we all now what's in store for all this evening's winners. That's
  right, the magnificent Crucified Gumby, as witnessed by all those attending
  Sydney Gatherings at my place. A thing of majestic beauty indeed.
  
  Evolution has played a major part of all our lives. Without it we'd still
  be single-cell amoebae floating around in that big ol' primordial ooze. Now
  I'm not saying it's not a place to visit, but let's face it; it had its
  drawbacks. So without further adieu, let's get the ball rolling and present
  the awards.
  
  The first award on offer tonight is the Memorial "I can't seem to get the
  last nail in" Crucified Gumby presented (one each) to the previous Report
  writers. So would Waz, Steve, Sebastian, Annette and Andrew please come up
  to the podium.
  
  [Everyone arrives on stage to collect awards, as they stand together a
  large trapdoor opens plunging them into a pit full of hungry Man-Eating
  cows. Cows eat award-winners, everyone is happy, /Matt comes back on stage]
  
  Right, now all previous report-writers have deceased I hope you all agree
  that this is indeed the best report to date.
  
  [Everyone laughs at /Matt's marvellously witty banter]
  
  The "Obsolete Technology Discussion Done to Death" Gumby goes to Ralph and
  Steve Leahy for their marvellous exchange on Apple //e computers:
  
  >> [1] Mind you, having a cupboard-full of //es and peripherals for spare parts
  >>    and bookcases full of //e and //c-related literature and software does
  tend
  >>     to get on the nerves of other members of the household... :-)
  
  >Note the footnote: I live in a small flat with a pregnant wife, and we nearly
  >came to blows over finding room for ONE computer, let alone 3 or 4.
  
  > I've been tempted, now that a //e or C64 would only cost me $50, but on the
  > other hand, I blew up my last Apple ][ with a home made interface card, so
  > perhaps it's safer this way.
  
  Hey! You're not a *real* Apple ][ computer buff until you've cooked at
  least one 6502 processor that way[1] :-)

  [1] And at $16 or so a time to replace them, it's something you try to do as
      seldom as possible. And at around $27 a time, a 65C02 is something you
      ensure you don't barbecue.
  
  As Steve is (ahem) no longer with us, I'd like to invite Ralph up to
  collect the Gumby.
  
  [Ralph cautiously comes up to the stage, looking extremely paranoid and
  pondering the real worth this Gumby holds. Sure he's worked his whole life
  towards this moment, but is it worth dying for? He walks up, collects his
  Gumby and returns to his seat without incident. Aren't anti-climaxes fun??]
  
  The "Polite as a Royal Corgi (and only Twice As Tall)" Gumby goes once
  again to Nina for both her actual and virtual lack-of-height. Would Nina
  like to come up to the stage to say a few words and so that we can all
  laugh at her.
  
  [remember to get milk-crate or phone-book for Nina to stand on to make her
  acceptance speech]
  
  Nina: Like to thank all I would for making jokes my height continuously.
  
  Right, that's enough. Here's some Chocolate Syrup, go sit down next to
  Townsley (MT) and he'll show you how to use it.
  
  Now to follow up this award the Gumby for "Most Humiliating Put-Down to a
  Short person" goes to everyone's favourite Sheep Casanova, Gene for the
  following response to Holly's post :
  
  > >Personally, I think being tall would actually be a negative quality - I
  > >mean, who is it that has decided that it's bad to be short??
  > >
  
  The guy who invented high shelves.

  Now I would like to take the time to welcome the other newsgroups that are
  tuned into tonight's ceremony. First we have soc.culture.kuwait.moderated,
  and what a fine bunch of people they are. That's right you all saw the war
  on CNN, but is there more to those incredibly rich oligarchy-based culture
  than meets the lens? Well yes, indeed there is.
  
  So without further fanfare (or verbal diahorrea) I would like to present
  the Gumby for Most Forgotten Modern War/Culture/News Item to Ibrahim Dashti
  for his marvellous insights and observations on Kuwait, and his fine
  understanding of why the Western World defended a bunch of misogynistic
  rich bastards.
  
  The Gumby for Most Forgotten/Ignored/Unheard Modern Culture goes to
  soc.culture.tajik, may all the participants of this culture around the
  world rejoice in finally being recognised by people with nothing better to
  do than read this report.
  
  And to finish off tonight's Foreign section we would like to present the
  Gumby for Stinking Pack of Smelly Redneck Assholes to the newly formed
  soc.org.kkk. You may now come up to the stage and collect your specially
  prepared "Burnt at the Cross" Crucified Gumby. [Why does Gumby deserve to
  die? Simple, he's different.]
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Klingons Off the Starboard Bow" Gumby for Delurking Newbie Most Likely
  to be Ignored goes to Christopher Willacy (willacc@citec.qld.gov.au) for
  this revelation:
  
  >Did you know that I am Scully's brother?
  
  >Its true ya know. We came from the same strand of DNA. But we weren't cloned
  >at the same time. I was cloned later, before she wasn't cloned after I wasn't
  >not cloned, she was.
  
  We ask that Chris not come up to the stage as we all just want to forget
  about him as quickly as possible.
  
  The next award is the Memorial Kirsty Weatherhog "Shift-One" Gumby. Now
  there were no obvious DD rantings evident this week, so I propose this
  award be jack-potted until next week for Matt-5's report.
  
  The "Token Witty X-Files related reference whilst not actually being an
  actual X-Files related post" Gumby goes to Callum Bowen
  (cbowen@metz.une.edu.au) for this rip-snorter:
  
  : BTW whats Slurp?
  :
  The sound made by (for example) a genetically altered, liver seeking,
  hibernating mutant being squished by a department store escalator...;)
  
  ****************************
  
  Matt-5 came close to winning the "Token Reference" Gumby, so instead we
  shall honour his efforts with the "Fire and Brimstone Eternal Damnation"
  Gumby for invoking this train of thought onto the newsgroup (though it is a
  great quote) in reference to penguin-shaped mothers:
  
  > Does she ever look anything like a fat little nazi stormtrooper?
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Cirrhosis of the Gumby" Gumby was a tough contest. I'm proud to
  announce the 4th Melbourne Gathering came in as runner-up for their
  debaucherous drinking at the 'Net Cafe (or whatever it's called). However
  the winner of this award has to go to both Antti and myself for our St.
  Patrick's Day Bash during my recent sojourn to Canberra. For those
  interested we started at around 7pm in a dingy Irish Pub and were there
  until 2am, when we were thrown out, only to continue our drinking for
  another hour at another establishment.
  
  
  The "Stupid Disfigured to Look Like a Cardassian" Gumby goes to Daniel
  Frankham for this gem on the NOTXF: DS9 thread:
  
  >(Star Trek is exactly the kind of show the Ferengi would try to
  >sell humans, don't ya think?  :-p)
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Forrest Gumby Life's Like A Box Of Chocolates" Gumby for Inane
  Philosophising goes to the main participants in the "Re: boy' obsessed re:
  re: re: blah blah blah" thread. So a Gumby each to Matt-5 and Annette (if
  she's still alive) for their war of words. Special mention to all others
  involved in this thread and even the "Who is Mulchy?" one (answer: who
  fucking cares!) , and especially Holly for her otherwise completely useless
  "Go Matt!" post.
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Morality bites" Gumby for GA Drooling And Associated Obsessive
  Behaviour should go to Gene and Matt-5 for posts under the "GA in FHM"
  thread. But in the interest of viewer safety (and gastronomics) we thought
  it'd be a bad idea to put them anywhere near anything covered in Plastic,
  Rubber or PVC (and inflatable at that).
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Mentally Incapacitated, They're Coming to Take Me Away" Gumby for Most
  Warped Comment To Come Out Of Daniel All Week goes to (surprise) Daniel Lam
  for this effort:
  
  >We got a brand new character in the show ... the Well Cooked Man.
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Obligatory Gee That's A Really Cool .sig" Gumby goes to Robert "The
  Main man" Whyte for his latest one:
  
  .rotinom eht edisni morf ekil skool ti tahw si sihT
  
  ****************************
  
  Now Steve Turtle put up a brave fight and almost started another .sig war
  in his efforts to keep coming up with witty remarks about Rob Whyte's .sig.
  But sadly, he failed [dramatic pause]. But we're not going to let Steve
  walk away a loser (well we'll do our best anyway). At the Gumby's
  everyone's a winner!! Accept of course for all you losers, but hey (and
  let's face it) we just don't care about you.
  
  So, Steve, if you would like to come up to stage and collect your "Serene"
  Gumby for Most Calming Influence in the Newsgroup for your lengthy
  explanation on why $teve 2 shouldn't hate Kirsty for breaking his heart and
  tossing him aside like the pool worthless rag he is (cruel, but fair!).
  
  
  The hybrid "Jim Henson/Banana Splits" Gumby For Token Reference of Muppets
  and/or Daggy 60's Kid's TV Shows goes to Gene for this one:
  
  >Hmmm...should I reveal my true identity or continue to play with your
  >mind? Ok I'll tell, In a previous life I was Jan Thurling. (Now your
  >probably still asking "who-who, who-who"!!) Elmo
  
  Hmm, that name seems familiar. But your new one is far more well known.
  So how long have you been away from Seasame Street?
  
  Gene
  
  ****************************
  
  Everyone's favourite Villain, $teve 2, picks up the "Quite A Funny Guy Once
  You Overlook His Personality" Gumby for this ROTFLer:
  
  >A gladiator with *any* personality... the world waits in vain hope :-)
  
  Meanwhile, in the Gladiator Camp they spake
  
  An ATXF member with a real body?  I'd like to see that.
  
  ****************************
  
  And while you're up here take another Gumby for Most Obscure Blatantly
  Plagiarised Self Put-Down for this one:
  
  $teve 2
  Who needs contraceptives when you've got my personality?
  
  ****************************
  
  The "Unfashionably Politically Correct" Gumby goes to Daniel Frankham and
  Matt-5 for their adherence to PC protocols under the "TAN: "Mad Cow"
  Disease" thread.
  
  A special Gumby is going out to Christopher Stuart for his impressive
  report of the 4th Melbourne Gathering. I mean anyone who actually kept
  count on what everyone drank deserves some recognition.
  
  ****************************
  
  The last Crucified Gumby on offer tonight is the
  "StupidfuckinginterferingbusybodyGodIreallyhateyouallNowgoawayandleavemealon
  eyouallbugme" Gumby which (suprisingly enough) goes to the mysterious
  hyphen (pronounced "-"), otherwise known as aissande@kraken.itc.gu.edu.au
  for Persistence Above and Beyond in Advocating A Newsgroup Split.
  
  This is indeed a special Gumby. Monks in an ancient temple in Tibet have
  given this Gumby weird magical powers. To describe it briefly it will
  shrivel your brain, genitals, ego, charisma and personality until you
  resemble what we all think of you.
  
  
  And that just about brings about the close of this Inaugural Gumby Awards.
  We hope all you winners are grinners, and that all you losers just keep out
  of way. The obligatory interview was supposed to be with the Merchandising
  Queen, Ms. Annette Fraser but due to technical difficulties (ie. I forgot
  to mail her the questions on Friday afternoon. Guess I'm not perfect after
  all.) it will published sometime during the week.
  
  
  So this is /Matt, the deity of a new generation wshing you all goodnight.
  And as we always say, "May Gumby have mercy on your souls".
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Oops, due to the miracle of time travel I now have Annette's interview.
  Here it is.
  
  Annette
  
  1. What is your age?
  
  32 (ugh)
  
  2. What was your first X-Files episode?
  
  The Pilot
  
  3. What is your favourite X-Files episode?
  
  `Roland' because it has the grossest imagery of any episode in my opinion.  I
  just love the death by immersing the head in liquid nitrogen and the police
  tape outline in the next scene with just little crosses for thawed out bits of
  brain is inspired.  However, I also love `Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose' and
  the one that Skinner headbuts someone in, one of the trilogy.  There are a lot
  of episodes that have certain scenes I love, but these are the ones that hang
  together as a whole the best for me.
  
  4. What is your least favourite X-Files episode?
  
  Hmmmm, this is difficult.  I'd have to say `Darkness Falls', because I can't
  work out why they didn't light a big fire, and definitely `Fearful Symmetry'
  because it was just stupid.
  
  5. Why do you like The X-Files?
  
  Because it's interesting, scary, excellent characterisations, the two leads
  don't automatically leap into bed together.  It's intelligent and usually well
  thought-out and the cinematography is sensational, especially for a weekly
  TV-show.
  
  6. What computer do you use?
  
  A Power Macintosh 6100/66 (at work because I'm too poor to buy one).
  
  7. If you were Mulder and you found Scully naked, tied up and smeared
  with chocolate sauce you would:
  
  Laugh probably, then untie her and never let her forget it.
  
  8. Marital status?
  
  Single
  
  9. Desperation status?
  
  On what scale?  I suppose wavering from not at all to manic.
  
  10. Other must-see shows?
  
  Seinfeld, Law and Order (whenever they bring it back), Frontline, ER, Water
  Rats (actually, I really like it, especially that guy who plays that diver,
  hubba hubba), Melrose Place (when I can be bothered), Media Watch, AFL
  football (sad isn't it).
  
  11. What TV shows should they bring back?
  
  The Goodies (there can never be too many reruns)
  
  12.  What TV shows should be euthanased immediately?
  
  The Naked Truth (has to be the most forced, overdone American crap I've ever
  seen), A Current Affair (and its ilk), The Footy Show
  
  13. If you were Scully and you found Mulder naked you would:
  
  Sigh, roll my eyes, shake my head and leave the room.  Or, go get a magnifying
  glass.
  
  14. How long have you been on the net?
  
  Well, for about two years now, except for that little hiatus when I started
  this job and had a problem posting (thanks Ken).
