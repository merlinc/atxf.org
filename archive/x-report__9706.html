  <h1>The Sixth Wollongong Report - 21 March 1997</h1>
  <b>by Ken Finlayson</b>
  <pre>
  
      The year is 50 BC. Usenet is entirely occupied by the RELmans. Well,
      not  entirely ... One small village of indominatable ATXFers  still
      holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the RELman
      legionaries  who  garrison the fortified camps of  Valium, Delurium,
      Sanguinarium and Z'ha'dum...
  
  
                             Hysterix the Galled in
  
                             O  W  N     G  O  E  L
  
  
  It was a regular cheerful day in the regular cheerful village of the
  indominatible ATXFers. The sun was shining and the birds were singing as
  the ATXFers went round their daily activities:
  
  Bawdylyrix was singing a suggestive song (though it was hard to make out
  the words with all the sniggering he was doing).
  
  Alyx was placing a 'fresh' delivery of fish on her stall: "Lovely fresh
  pikes!" she called.
  
  Dominatrix was in her house, eating a muffin and toying with a pair of
  manacles.
  
  Chocolatecakemix was struggling to force her way out of her tiny house,
  filled as it was with 3,247 different representations of penguins.
  
  Hysterix was watching Robelix carve menhirs -- Robelix had already finished
  four, and was working on the fifth menhir. A flying saucer passed overhead,
  attracting the attention of Robelix's pet, Doddmatix, who barked loudly.
  
  And the author was desperately trying to find something interesting to
  write about when his concentration was ruined by Exclamationmarx running
  onto the village green, screaming terrible news:
  
  "BILL GATES IS STILL ALIVE!!!"
  
  Several ATXFers gasped in horror, and the frail hearted Psychotix passed
  out.
  
  "Um, no, wait," said Exclamationmarx, embarrassed. "That isn't it."
  
  She walked off. A moment later, a distant "Ah! Got it!" could be heard,
  followed quickly by the sight of a running Exclamationmarx, screaming:
  
  "GETASIG THE DRUID HAS VANISHED!!!!"
  
                                    * * * *
  
  The vilage chieftan, Teeveestatistix, addressed Hysterix and Robelix.
  
  "You've heard of Getasig's disappearance. This is a terrible thing to
  happen to our village, since it means we can no longer brew the potion that
  gives us our indominatable strength."
  
  "Nice piece of plot exposition there," commented Robelix.
  
  "Thank you. As you both know," Teeveestatistix continued, "we're rapidly
  approaching the time of our regular RELman punch-up scene, and our supplies
  of the potion are down to this last gourd."
  
  "Gourd gracious!"
  
  "If you don't find Getasig soon, our village is doomed to RELman occupation."
  
  "Never fear, O chief," said Hysterix, "We shall find Geta--"
  
  "No no no, don't just go and tell me directly."
  
  "Why not?"
  
  "It's far too inefficient."
  
  "It is?"
  
  "Of course. Look," said Teeveestatistix, as he handed the two heros a slab
  of stone each, "just enter your PIN numbers on these forms and hand it to
  the guard. Your consent will be automatically acknowledged."
  
  Hysterix and Robelix did as instructed. The guard passed the slabs on to
  the chief.
  
  "What's this?" Teeveestatistix hissed.
  
  "Hysterix and Robelix have agreed to search for Getasig," the guard hissed
  back.
  
  "Oh. Yes. Here, Hysterix, take the last of the potion with you and, gourd
  luck."
  
  "I can't stand any more of these terrible puns," whispered Hysterix.
  
  "Yes," Robelix whispered back, "let's gourd out of here."
  
                                    * * * *
  
  Hysterix and Robelix decided the first person to visit would be the
  reclusive Generix, who lived in the depths of the Generix Forest. They were
  accompanied by Saltlix, one of the village's better warriors, who was
  wearing a brightly coloured tunic ("That's a nice red shirt you're wearing,
  Saltlix," Hysterix had said earlier.)
  
  A group of Legionaries In Black sneaked past, carrying two prone small
  figures. "Arf! Arf-o! Arf-o!" barked Doddmatix. "Shh, Doddmatix," replied
  Robelix. "Probably just an owl," he said to Hysterix.
  
                                    * * * *
  
  Generix's home looked more than a little delapidated. Against one side of
  the house (and possibly constituting the major supporting structure) was a
  sheep pen. While Saltlix went round the back of the house to investigate,
  Hysterix stood at the door and knocked.
  
  The house groaned, its wooden mouth slowly opening.
  
  "Generix?" called Hysterix cautiously.
  
  "Yes?"
  
  "We're here to ask you some questions. We need your help."
  
  "Yes," agreed Robelix, "Do you have any roast lamb?"
  
  Hysetrix scowled.
  
  "The sheep aren't for eating," explained Generix. "I keep them for company.
  They live in the company baa'd room, and I called them Company B."
  
  "B? For what?"
  
  "Before I changed their name to Company C."
  
  "Why'd you do that?"
  
  "Because they're not a company of Bs. Anyone can C that."
  
  "This is getting ridiculous!"
  
  "What do you mean, 'getting'?" asked Robelix.
  
  "There's something strange about these woods," continued Generix.
  
  "Yes, it's you," muttered Hysterix.
  
  "It seems condusive to producing talking animals. For instance, I have a
  talking sheep."
  
  "That's impossible!"
  
  "Who said anything about bulls? I'm speaking of Daniel, lamb who talks."
  
  "What's he talk about?"
  
  "Distant relations."
  
  "What?"
  
  "He was always talking about far kin."
  
  (That's cutting it fine, isn't it, kiddies?)
  
  "You've got a talking lamb? Prove it."
  
  "Oh, he escaped. I think he joined a herd of wild phwoars."
  
  "Of course I've heard of wild phwoars," replied Robelix.
  
  "*That*," said Hysterix despairingly, "must be the most obvious line ever."
  
  "Have you forgotten who wrote this?"
  
  There was a scream from the back of the house, and it wasn't just because of
  the low quality of the writer's jokes.
  
  "Saltlix!" cried Hysterix and Robelix in unison.
  
  All three rushed round to the back of the house, where they saw nothing but
  the back of a horse.
  
  "Saltlix?"
  
  The horse belched,and turned to face the heros.
  
  "Hello," said the horse. "I'm Mr Eddie. Mr Eddie Van Song."
  
  He belched again. Suddenly Hysterix realised what had happened.
  
  "You ate the great Saltlix?"
  
  "And I'd like some more, mon."
  
  "Pretending to be Jamaican won't help."
  
  "Will utah just shut up!" cried Generix.
  
  "Wil-bur!"
  
  Generix urgently ushered them around to the front of the house.
  
  "The answer to your problem lies with Economix. I can't say any more."
  
  "Why not?" asked Hysterix menacingly.
  
  "I don't have any more lines. Now go!"
  
                                    * * * *
  
  In a scene strikingly similar to earlier, Hysterix stood on a doorstep,
  striking the door, causing a scene.
  
  "Go away! I'm busy!" came a voice from inside the house.
  
  "Busy? Doing what?"
  
  The door opened, and Economix peered out.
  
  "Oh, it's you Hysterix. I don't have much time for visitors at the moment,
  I'm busy writing my latest essay."
  
  "What do you know about Getasig's disappearance?"
  
  "Me? Nothing! I had nothing to do with that!"
  
  Robelix muttered to Hysterix "The lady doth protest too much, methinks."
  
  "Lady?" asked Econmix, turning his head from side to side, "Where? Where?"
  
  "It was a metaphor," Robelix explained.
  
  "I didn't meet her for anything! Honest!"
  
  "Look -- what do you know about Getasig's disap--"
  
  "All right, all right, I'll tell you: my evil twin's escaped! I think he's
  behind this scheme."
  
  "Your twin? Uptohisoldtrix?"
  
  "Yes, he is."
  
                                    * * * *
  
  Following a tip-off from someone who wanted to get the X Report finished
  urgently, Hysterix and Robelix went to a grassy plain some distance away
  from the village, overlooking the sea.
  
  While they expected to see Uptohisoldtrix performing some dastardly deed
  (like extending the life of the current X Report), all they found was a
  man busily carving a long message.
  
  A bell rang in Robelix's mind -- that, or he had tinnitis again.
  
  Robelix suddenly lunged at the man. He picked him up, and proceeded to swing
  the fellow around his head several times. Finally, Robelix released him. The
  person flew off into the distance. On the other side of the Alps, a cloud of
  smoke slowly rose.
  
  "You didn't need to do that."
  
  "Why not?"
  
  "He was the author."
  
  "So what's your point?"
  
  "Um..."
  
  "Anyhow, he made a crack about my editing."
  
  "But that never saw print."
  
  "Well, now he's an imprint."
  
  "Charming!"
  
  "Prints charming?"
  
  Hysterix suddenly noticed that something had fallen out of the author's
  pockets when Robelix had lifted him up. She took it, and examined it
  closely.
  
  It was something resembling an old fashioned perfume applicator, totally
  anachronistic and just the sort of thing a meddling author would leave lying
  around. In elegant handwriting, a label on the front declared it to be "Plot
  accelerant, use with caution."
  
  Hysterix squeezed the bulb, releasing a cloud of purple haze. It thinned,
  and vanished.
  
  The two heros waited.
  
  "Fat lot of use that was," she muttered.
  
  A palatial residence fell from the sky, landing neatly in front of the two
  trees.
  
  Hysterix looked questioningly at her companion.
  
  "Manor from heaven."
  
  Two busts atop pillars plummeted from the sky. The pillars thundered down
  onto the trees, splintering them utterly, leaving a halo of wooden shreds
  around the pillars' base.
  
  Hysterix peered at the inscription on each.
  
  "CANIS REX," she read.
  
  "He certainly does," added Robelix.
  
  "And FELIX REGINA."
  
  "Reigning cats and dogs."
  
  Evil laughter came from the depths of the house, echoing madly around and
  around, starting a strong wind. Robelix was unaffected, but had Hysterix
  not grabbed hold of Robelix's leg she would have been blown away.
  
  "What now?" asked Hysterix, resignededly.
  
  "Goel-forced winds."
  
  The winds died down. A fox scampered across the front of the manor,
  bringing with it needles of rain which stung the skin they struck.
  
  "Rain-hard the fox," muttered Robelix.
  
  "Is there any reason for all these terrible puns?"
  
  "Is there *any* ever reason?" replied Robelix. "I suspect we're approaching
  a climatic finish."
  
  "And only one person could be responsible for these puns."
  
  "The author."
  
  "That's not who I had in mind."
  
  Inside, a surprising sight met their eyes: the villagers were milling
  around, holding drinks and making uneasy conversation. Alyx, Archivix,
  Bawdylyrix, Chocolatecakemix, Dominatrix, Exclamationmarx, Fanatix, Generix,
  Newbix, Teeveestatistix and his brother Postingstatistix, Psychotix,
  Xixax, Weetbix -- simply everyone was here.
  
  "What are you all doing here?"
  
  "Economix invited us all over to his manor warming party," explained
  Teeveestatistix, patting the shoulder of Economix, who now looked
  distinctly nervous.
  
  "But that's not Economix," explained Robelix, "he's far too busy writing."
  
  "It's true," added Hysterix, "that's *really* Economix's evil twin!"
  
  "Uptohisoldtrix!" everyone gasped.
  
  Uptohisoldtrix started to run, but Robelix grabbed him and held him fast.
  
  Hysterix ripped opened a crate labelled "Plot expediency, this way up".
  Inside was the missing Getasig.
  
  "It's not as simple as you think," commented Getasig.
  
  Getasig reached for Uptohisoldtrix's face.
  
  "Uptohistoldtrix is *really* --"
  
  Getasig grabbed onto the beard and pulled. Uptohisoldtrix's face peeled
  away. In his hands, Getasig held a mask, and the true face of the man
  called Uptohisoldtrix was revealed.
  
  "Economix!" gasped Teeveestatistix.
  
  "Yes," said Getasig, "Economix disguised himself as his evil twin. Under
  this disguise he kidnapped me."
  
  "And I would have gotten away with it except for those pesky kids and their
  dog!"
  
  "But why, Economix? Why?"
  
  "Ask the writer, I've no idea."
  
                       In lieu of a better explanation,
  
                                 T H E   E N D
  
                                    * * * *
  
  Of course, none of Hysterix and Robelix's adventures would be complete
  without a banquet around a huge bonfire under the starry sky. There was
  indeed such a banquet, with all the villagers present, and much drinking
  and merrymaking (although Bawydlyrix couldn't make it, having an earlier
  engagement of being tied up to a tree and gagged).
  
  When there seemed to be a suitable pause, Robelix stood and made an
  annoucement:
  
  "The Fifth Menhir is proud to present the Sixth Wollongong Report,
  presented proudly by Slifox, who will award awards and give presents
  presently."
  
  Slifox stood, holding in one hand a list of the night's award winners.
  Meanwhile Robelix, dressed in a slinky sequinned black number stood next
  to the trophies, which were model menhirs built on a 1:1 scale.
  
  "The first award of the evening goes to Robin Harrison, nominated by
  Rachael Bahl. Robin receives the 'ON AND ON ANON' AWARD for admitting he

  then at Robelix.

  "The EUREKA AWARD for best theory about an episode goes to Wolfgang Schoepf,
  who wrote:
  
    One of the big unanswered questions is and was, why doesn't CM simply kill
    Mulder? And not only that, he even helps to save him sometimes.
  
    One theory of course is, that he is or could be Mulder's father. I don't
    like to believe that.
  
    We learned in Musings (if we can believe it), that CM wants to be famous,
    and wants to be known. And he's not entirely happy with his life, longing
    for a second chance. Apart from the book-writing stuff, this became even
    more obvious in the conversation with DT.
  
    No, maybe he sees Mulder as his biggest chance to become famous. Mulder is
    the only one who has the will, the guts, and maybe even the talent to
    expose CM, what he did and the project. Which would make CM famous.
  
  "The 'PLOT HOLE SPELUNKING' AWARD for pointing out flaws in 'Musings of a
  Cigarette Smoking Man' is shared by Wolfgang Schoepf and Vanessa Meachen.
  
  "Wolfgang pointed out the problem of Cancerman's age:
  
    So, CM appeared in 1940, which probably means that he was born around that
    time. Also makes sense with his army career in 1962, where he looked 
    20-odd-ish. Unfortunately, doesn't resolve the TFWID double-soul mystery.
    And even more unfortunately, it doesn't make sense at all WRT Apocrypha.
    I suggest, it's just sloppy writing, or, as has been pointed out before, a
    lack of continuity.
  
  "Vanessa wrote about the Cigarette Smoking Man's eponymous addiction:
  
    Another continuity error - CM was a smoker in Apocrypha, which was set in
    the fifties, yet in Musings he didn't start till after the JFK

    The scene was DT (Deep Throat) saying to CM (Cancer Man) you're the
    killer and I am the liar. CM responds by saying "I've never killed

    alien thus demonstrating his killing. I think CM and DT are both in

    This is hogwash, Steve.
    I was in London during the Doctor Who years - it is quite obvious that there
    was little attempt by the British Government to hide their tests. The Tardis
    appeared quite frequently, and openly, on street corners throughout the city
    and surrounds, in plain view of the public. As a child I even ventured inside
    it on more than one occasion. Naturally the internal dimensions and
    operational areas were well disguised.

    You say Arthur C. Clarke has never tried the same thing again ... what about

    Steve, this is one of the most common cop-outs by people who really have no
    material to back up their argument. How do you know that I am not familiar
    with the field. As it so happens I had been introduced to the "theory" of
    future stealing quite a few years ago, and was convinced then that it was
    nothing more than lunatic ravings. My sources however are confidential.

    Wasn't Project Maestro implicated in the Roswell incident, in particular with
    reference to the use of hitherto undisclosed materials in the construction of
    experimental aircraft. This theory has been trashed so many times it's not
    funny! How far into the future are we supposed to believe we're looking here?
    Surely, if these Project Maestro people were so successful in developing this
    sort of technology ... or at least proposing it's future development, as you
    seem to be suggesting, then when can we expect to see it came into regular
    use? Or haven't the user manuals been written far enough ahead for them to be
    "seen" yet?

    Now I seriously doubt your sanity, Steve. The William Maxwell that you're
    referring to is currently 84 and suffering from Parkinsons ... he's already
    vowed that he's not going to write any more ... I think you're confusing him
    with George Maxwell, his son. 
    If you can't even name the author correctly, how are we to believe that you
    have any idea about the subject?

    ... and I suppose Shakespeare plagiariged Wyrd Sisters for Macbeth, huh?
    
    If what you are saying is true, although I'm having great trouble accepting
    too much of it, then Helen Demidenko may have been grossly misjudged and
    falsely accused, and in fact have actually had her own works stolen in the
    past?

    Steve, I know that some of this topic is, to you at least, highly sensitive,
    but I think encrypting part of your argument and posting it in a public forum
    is overly melodramatic.
    
  "Suspiciously, the two Steves nominated each other for the 'OBSTINACY IN THE
  FACE OF THE FACTS' AWARD. Worse still, Annette Fraser advocated it.
  
  "Anyone else who contributed to this nonsense (Holman! Frankham!) can join
  the queue for the acetone injections (thanks, Antti). The two Steves have
  been given the cell adjoining Mr Finlayson's.
  
  "That concludes the Sixth Wollongong Report."
  
  "So it's goodnight from him," said Turtle.
  
  "And it's goodnight from him," said Leahy.

  This week's interview was supposed to have been with the ever popular No One!
  (Well, that's who he said he was). Unfortunately, he's not as trustworthy as
  the X Files would have us believe, because after I lent him the $1000 he
  said he needed to research the answers to the interview, I never saw him
  again.
  
  So there isn't any interview.
