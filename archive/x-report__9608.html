  [1] Yes, I know that's not a real word, and no, I don't know how to
  pronounce it. [2]
  [2] Yes, I know this footnote should be at the bottom, but this is
  *really* long, and I don't think people's attention spans are long
  enough. :)
  
  The Inaugural Syzygenous Report
  ===============================
  
  By Holly "Wimp" Alexander <gfM>.
  
  -------------------------------
  
  The car sped along the road, its two occupants immersed in tense silence.
  Matt-5 was busy examining the map which had been tossed onto his lap by
  the woman sitting beside him a number of hours ago when they'd first left
  the outskirts of the city.
  
  Matt-5 cast a sidelong glance at his companion, desperately hoping that
  she wouldn't notice his sudden ignorance when it came to all things
  map-like, or in anyway scientific. She ignored his gaze, and pushed her
  small foot even harder against the accelerator.
  
  He shifted his eyes back to the map, slowly coming to the realisation
  that they were drawing nearer to their destination. He saw a stop sign
  approaching, and vaguely remembering the instructions that he had
  received all those hours ago, he said hesitantly, "Uh, according to
  Annette, you turn left at that stop light up ahead."
  
  Her gaze remained steadily fixed on the road as she said curtly, "That's
  not a stop light - it's a stop *sign*."
  
  He could have pointed out that, well, really if you were just examining
  the effectiveness of its stopping ability, it didn't actually make a
  difference whether it was a stop sign, or a stop light - both of them
  caused you to stop. But somehow, the thrill of pedantry suddenly deserted
  him. Instead he simply replied, "Sure. Fine. Whatever."
  
  Lyndal turned and glared at him. He felt the anger resonating from her,
  and tried to break the mood with a joke. The memory of a familiar
  exchange echoed in his head, and he grasped at it desperately, "Uhh...
  whip me some more?" Somehow, saying the words now just didn't sound
  right. Lyndal's face remained stony. Matt-5 tried again, "uh, chocolate
  topping? Mitch? $teve?--" Her face softened slightly and he allowed
  himself to relax as they finally pulled up in front of the building that
  Annette had selected for the Inaugural Syzygenous Report.
  
  It was January 12, 1996.
  
  As the pair approached the building, they noticed something strange.
  Lyndal looked at her watch - it was nine-thirty pm, which meant that she
  and Matt were half an hour late. Logically, the building they were now
  entering should be full of atxf-ers... Brimming with them... and when
  there were a crowd of atxf-ers there was bound to be noise...
  
  But all they were greeted with as they made their way down the long,
  empty corridors was total silence.
  
  Lyndal was suddenly suspicious, "Matt, are you *sure* it was tonight?
  This wasn't just some elaborate prank to get me on my own, I hope?
  Because I will *not* put up with that! I'm just not that sort of girl!"
  
  Matt-5 looked worried. Then they rounded the corner and were met with a
  scene that rendered them both speechless. There in front of them was the
  entire atxf community. Everyone who had ever contributed a post was
  there: Annette, Marcus, Gene, Steve Leahy, Dregs, -A-, Alicia, Isikeli,
  Intensity, Nina, Anne and Sarah, The Oracle, Slifox, Antti, Ingrid, Ralph,
  Robert Whyte, /Matt, Pamela Lee (no, not *that* one), Stephen Turtle,
  Daniel Frankham, Daniel Lam, Steven Richardson, Mark Robbins... [author's
  note: there's more! I know... I just couldn't count past this many...]
  along with row upon row of faces of people they'd never seen before.
  Lyndal and Matt-5 were shocked into silence - which went quite well with
  the atmosphere: the room was deadly quiet. Not a whisper, not a giggle,
  not even a ROTFL! was escaping from the lips of these zombie-like people.
  
  There was no discussion of muffin recipes, no theories being tossed
  around about what would happen to a dog or a cat if it was passed over
  one of those supermarket check-out things, no mention of the various ways
  of getting a whole row of seats on the bus to yourself, no comments on
  pinball machines, no questioning of whether Dana or Melissa was the older
  sister, no joking, no teasing, no pedantry! (Although when Lyndal
  listened *very* hard, she thought she just caught the whisper of
  commentary being carried out by a few people. Lyndal strained her ears;
  was it at all possible that what she could just hear were observations,
  opinions and analyses of the latest X-Files episode? She shook her head
  abruptly and ignored the noise - it was obviously just a figment of her
  imagination.)
  
  They had nothing to say to one another. The universe was out of kilter,
  and the atxf community were right in the middle of it all.
  
  At Lyndal and Matt-5's arrival, there had been a subtle shift in the
  atmosphere. A few people had stirred, and turned their heads towards the
  doorway, while still remaining as unmoved as ever. Then, from the shadows
  a figure emerged and came running towards Lyndal. He threw himself at her
  passionately, and hugged her with all his might. As the mysterious hugger
  withdrew from Lyndal's startled embrace she saw that tears glistened in
  the very edges of his eyes.
  
  "Lyndal! Lyndal... you're here!  I've been waiting all night for you..."
  Matt-5 looked on in alarm as /Matt gave Lyndal a final hug and then
  returned to the shadows.
  
  "But-- but, I thought... I thought he didn't-- I thou--" Matt-5 was lost
  for words. Lyndal glared at him again, and stormed off.
  
  As she circled angrily through the gathered hordes, she started to absorb
  the tiny details that had escaped her until now. Scraps of conversations
  made their way to her ears. She glanced at Annette, who was
  half-heartedly playing with her Captain Scarlet figurine, scowling
  angrily at anyone who came near. A pile of magazines and assorted
  merchandise items lay scattered at her feet, but instead of protecting
  them reverentially, she had her feet on top of them, and was kicking the
  various items around the floor. Pamela Lee and Gene were in a corner
  amiably discussing the merits and demerits of Scully's actions in
  "Grotesque". Lyndal heard Pamela say somewhat incoherently, "yeah, well,
  you know - I just don't reckon' Scully should have pulled that gun on
  Mulder."
  
  Gene replied, "But why, Pamela? You have to admit, Mulder was behaving
  pretty suspiciously throughout the whole investigation. He was being an
  absolute dolt, I think!"
  
  Pamela replied unenthusiastically, "Sure. Fine. Whatever."
  
  Lyndal continued to stroll through the group, feeling her anger slowly
  starting to ease.
  
  She saw Dregs standing in the centre of the room, talking. His words were
  deep and full of meaning. The crowd of people that had gathered around
  him treated his every word with respect. They moved closer, eager to hear
  what he was saying.
  
  Lyndal was so fascinated with this sight that she walked straight into
  Nina who had been lurking near the wall. Lyndal started to apologise, but
  was cut off by Nina as she snarled nastily, "Watch where you're going,
  b****."
  
  Lyndal gasped and walked away quickly.
  
  In the meantime, Matt-5 had been sitting in the corner thinking. It was
  taking him a while, but finally things were starting to click together.
  The strangeness of people's behaviour, Lyndal's snappiness, the bizarre
  chill he'd felt ever since leaving the city... of course! It all made sense!
  
  Forgetting that she was as grumpy as hell, he ran over to Lyndal and
  tugged on her arm.
  
  "Hey! Get your hands off me!" She cried.
  
  Matt-5's hands quickly dropped to his side, but he soldiered on,
  regardless of the dark looks she was throwing him.
  
  "Lyndal - I think I've figured out what's going on here... It's a syz-- a
  sylg-- a szrch--" he sighed in exasperation and said bluntly, "a
  conjunction of the planets. I can't remember which ones... I, uh, should
  have a book around here somewhere--" he cast his eyes quickly around and
  saw only empty space.
  
  Lyndal rolled her eyes and said curtly, "You mean a syzygy? The
  conjunction between planets? In this case, the once-in-every-84-years
  phenomenon of the conjuction of Mars, Uranus and Mercury while Uranus is
  in the House of Aquarius?"
  
  Matt-5 nodded mutely.
  
  Suddenly there was a noise at the door behind them. Lyndal and Matt-5
  swivelled around and were greeted with an aloof look of disdain as
  Princess Holly entered the room. Every single pair of eyes in the room
  swung in her direction, and a collective gasp emerged from the crowd as
  they stared in awe at the vision of beauty, intelligence, and wit that
  had just entered--
  
  [well, we *are* talking about a group of people under the influence of
  the conjunction of Mercury, Mars and Uranus, don't forget.... <pause> Oh,
  alright, maybe I've gone a bit far]
  
  -- then everyone quickly returned to what they were doing before. Which
  was not much.
  
  Holly looked around the room, and started biting her lip anxiously. She
  waved her arm up in the air, and then - realising that wasn't going to do
  any good - clambered onto the nearest chair, and *then* raised her arm in
  the air, trying to get everyone's attention. It wasn't until they noticed
  the fluttering pieces of paper in her hand that people slowly turned in
  Holly's direction.
  
  Matt-5 observed Holly in puzzlement. So far, she seemed to be acting
  perfectly in character. Well... except for that look of disdain thing
  when she'd walked in, but that could easily be attributed to that short
  joke he'd made... No, it seemed to him that Holly had most definitely
  remained unaffected by the effects of being in Australia's own cosmic
  g-spot. He looked around with a slightly befuddled gaze and tried to
  discern if anyone else was behaving normally.
  
  He noticed that The Oracle appeared to be curled up in the corner,
  asleep. Matt-5 quietly drew nearer and heard his slumberous mutterings;
  "Mmm... I like to *eat* muffins...--" Matt-5 drew back quickly, his ears
  turning slightly red. But he couldn't resist listening to the rest,
  "Wait! Wait - I want to go with Lyndal... I want to go see the woman's
  movie!"
  
  <chick flick> The words popped into Matt-5's mind, and sounded vaguely
  familiar.
  
  The Oracle continued his recitation, "So.. Lyndal?? How was the film? Oh.
  Who's that? What are you doing under the seats Lyndal? Is that your
  boyfriend? ... "
  
  Matt-5 was so intently focused on The Oracle's words that he didn't
  immediately notice the silent figure that had appeared next to him,
  leaning forward slightly in an attempt to hear what The Oracle was
  saying. It wasn't until the rustling of paper caught his attention, that
  Matt-5 turned and saw Holly standing there, notepad in hand, furiously
  taking down the details of The Oracle's dream. Holly glanced quickly at
  Matt-5, implying with the raising of an eyebrow that he had better not
  awaken the Dreaming One, while also managing to grin wickedly and wink,
  much to Matt-5's surprise.
  
  "Aren't you supposed to be preparing the X-Report?" Matt-5 asked anxiously.
  
  Holly looked at him guiltily and quickly scurried off. At the sound of
  her departure, The Oracle woke up abruptly and seeing the Princess
  daintily climbing onto a chair, leapt up from the floor and shouted
  loudly, "WHERE'S THE X-REPORT, HOLLY?"
  
  This time when all the eyes in the room swivelled in Holly's direction,
  they were filled with a desperate and eager anticipation. Holly looked at
  The Oracle, then slowly allowed her eyes to travel around the room as she
  nervously fingered the few ratty pages she held in her hand. She
  swallowed and said softly, "Uh... it's coming..."
  
  The hordes of atxf continued to stare at her. The weight of their gaze
  caused Holly to fidget even more nervously than before. She glanced down
  at the scrawled notes in her hands and her voice became even softer as
  she said waveringly, "It...um.. it just needs a few more minutes work..."
  She felt a slow, growing anger rise in the room and felt a simultaneous
  rise of terror within her. She knew that something big, something
  momentous needed to happen within the next few minutes, or else she'd be
  in serious trouble.
  
  At that exact moment, the room started to quiver. Holly didn't notice it
  at first, thinking that it was just her own nervous trembling that was
  causing her chair to quake. But then the shaking grew in force and Holly
  realised that something was going on. She quickly jumped off the chair,
  and took shelter under the nearest table, cowering in fright.
  
  The trembling continued for a few more minutes until, abruptly, it
  stopped.
  
  Holly looked at her watch - it was midnight, exactly. She peered out from
  under the table and looked on in bemusement as her fellow atxf-ers
  suddenly reverted back to their normal selves. Lyndal and Matt-5 had
  immediately retired into a corner. The crack of a whip could be heard,
  along with Matt-5's tiny whimpers of pleasure. Annette was fervently
  collecting her discarded merchandise - marking each item off against the
  list that she had pulled out of her pocket. Her Captain Scarlet figurine
  was firmly clasped in her right hand, and her thumb stroked him gently.
  Dregs was still standing in the middle of the room talking, but suddenly
  he was completely alone. Nina had returned to being her happy self and
  was sitting in front of the TV carefully watching "Nisei" and "731" -
  rewinding the tape repeatedly to try and catch every word of Japanese
  that was being uttered.
  
  And then the room started quaking again. This time, however, a repeated,
  distinctive sound echoed throughout the room. The trembling became more
  severe, and the sound grew louder and clearer. It was the unmistakable
  noise of high heels. They clacked purposefully along the wooden floor of
  the hallway, drawing nearer and nearer to the centre room. Holly held her
  breath and was aware of the merging of her gaze with those of the other
  atxf-ers as the owner of the high heels finally rounded the corner, and
  appeared in the doorway.
  
  "Gillian..." The whispered word was voiced simultaneously by every
  occupant in the room.
  
  Holly continued to watch as the ripples of reaction spread through the
  room. Daniel Lam was the first to go, collapsing in a heap of unvoiced
  innuendo on the floor. One by one they followed. Whether they were
  dropping to their knees in wonder, slithering to the ground in a state of
  unconsciousness, or merely retiring shyly to a nice seat at her feet,
  they were a mess.
  
  Gillian wore a look of amused puzzlement as she stared at the reaction
  she had caused. Her blue - or were they green? - eyes slowly toured the
  room, waiting for some sort of welcome... or maybe even a present or
  two... But all around her was mayhem. She saw a small, red-haired girl
  staring at her fixedly from under a table, her mouth slowly chanting,
  "Gillian, Gillian, Gillian..." Gillian smiled at the strange creature,
  who promptly fainted - a smile of rapturous joy painted across her face.
  Gillian continued to look around until her eye landed on a familiar face.
  Intensity was seated at a nearby table, doodling on his ascii-pad. She
  winked at him surreptitiously. Intensity glanced nervously around him
  before returning the wink and mouthing, "See you in Townsville."
  
  Music suddenly came blaring out of the speakers which were scattered
  around the room. Gillian listened intently, and a smile slowly crept onto
  her face as she recognised a blast from her past. The Circle Jerks. She
  searched out the source of the music, and saw a somewhat Finnish-looking
  gentlemen grinning at her happily from next to the stereo. She smiled
  warmly at him.
  
  Then, out of the slobbering mass of hysteria which surrounded the petite
  star, there emerged a figure ready and willing to take control of the
  situation. He walked straight up to Gillian, grasped her hand in a warm
  handshake and said bluntly, "Welcome to aus.tv.x-files, Gillian. My
  name's Steve Leahy - I'm the FAQ-maintainer and archivist."
  
  Gillian replied with as much directness, "Thanks Steve. Glad to be here.
  So, who are you all?"
  
  At that, Steve gently placed his arm on her shoulder and lead her slowly
  around the room, describing the history, content, and demographic
  features of atxf. As they slowly made their way through the room, he was
  able to point out objects of interest. Snatches of their hushed
  conversation echoed throughout the stillness.
  
  ".... and this is the Kirsty Weatherhog memorial..." The pair had drawn
  up in front of a glass case. Inside sat a sparkling, pure gold
  exclamation mark, while the words "OH MY GOD" could be heard
  reverberating joyously within the case.
  
  Gillian nodded seriously in appreciation. As they moved on, Steve
  whispered softly, "...we're all quite excited, as there's a rumour going
  around that Kirsty may be returning for a brief time." He looked around
  furtively then lowered his voice even more and added, "But of course, it
  could be just an elaborate hoax... We don't trust any outsiders around
  here..."
  
  "Of course not." Gillian replied, somewhat indulgently.
  
  Steve smiled and continued the tour. They were now standing in front of a
  plaque which bore a number of names. Gillian glanced quickly at the names
  and took note of a few: $teve, Mulchy, Kirsty, Waz, Dregs, John... She
  cast a curious glance at the man next to her. Steve followed her gaze and
  replied to her unanswered question speedily. "Oh, that's just our list of
  past-members - people who have left the group for one reason or
  another..." He looked at the list and frowned slightly, saying softly to
  himself, "Must remember to take $teve's name of the list if necessary."
  
  Both of them were blithely unaware of the person who had run up and
  joined them, and was now jumping up and down furiously in front of Steve.
  The voice of the invisible jumper did not reach either Gillian or Steve
  as they slowly returned to the front of the room. Dregs continued to
  shout after them, "But I came back!! Hey, Steve - take me off that list!
  I'm back - I came back!!" His futile cries were soon drowned out by the
  cacophony of scrapping chairs and excited whispers that was now filling
  the room as Gillian and Steve returned to their point of departure.
  
  Holly had regained her composure, and quickly joined them at the front of
  the room. The pages in her hand were still somewhat scrappy looking, but
  there were a lot more of them and her nervousness had almost completely
  deserted her. Almost.
  
  She coughed tentatively in order to attract the crowd's attention. They
  continued to chatter amongst themselves, ignoring her feeble attempts to
  quieten them down. It wasn't until Gillian stood up and sternly asked
  everyone to be quiet that a hush fell on the room.
  
  Holly dared not look at Gillian, for fear she would faint, but she
  silently thanked her and began to speak.
  
  "Um..well, hi everyone. Welcome to the inaugural - and final - Syzygenous
  Report. Otherwise known as the Holly Report. I.. I just wanted to
  apologise for the lateness of it... um, but here it is!" Holly beamed at
  the audience, who returned her look with their own distinctive smiles.
  Holly continued speaking, "And now, we're finally coming to the actual
  awards themselves. Sorry it's been a bit long in getting here.. Anyway,
  these awards are known as the Holly Report Honours, or HRHs for short,"
  Holly giggled and then continued, "and here we go..."
  
  =======================
  
  **The HRH for the most paranoid musings since the last report goes to
  Daniel Frankham for this comment:
  
  And the *really* spooky thing is... I checked out some of those
  letters recently (I keep them in a drawer in case this
  "Householder" ever comes looking for them)... and it turns out
  this guy *actually lives in my house*! It's like an X-File! My
  house has an alternate existence I know not of! Some guy, maybe a
  whole family, who occupy it without ever being seen by me... I
  guess they're always in the *other* rooms... Brrrrrr... I wonder
  if they know about me?
  
  (I don't mind so much if the bastards would just buy their own
  socks, and stop taking my bloody pens!)
  
  **The HRH for the person with the best ability to see things in a
  completely different light to everyone else goes to Annette Fraser for
  the following outburst:
  
  Did you know that Demidenko, read backwards, is Ok Ned, I'm Ed? (Apostrophe
  added of course).
  
  Well, you do now.
  
  **Oh, and while you're here, Annette, you'd better collect your *other*
  HRH - for best clarification of the *real* meaning behind Katrina's job:
  
  > I agree.  I have just graduated as an Atmospheric Scientist.  Now I thought
  this would

  > Katrina
  
  Perhaps they take 'Atmospheric Scientist' as meaning someone who's done a
  lot of study about how to really set the mood :-).
  
  **And the one and only "Group Effort HRH" goes to all the contributors to
  the following thread:

  Bring a weeks worth of ATXF print-outs onto the bus. People will judge
  you insane from your giggling and leave you alone (it works here at work).

  **OK, now for the "Best report by an atxf-er *not* under the influence of
  any drugs or alcohol" (sorry, /Matt - just couldn't count that lovely
  anti-Lyndal diatribe in this one... <g>) there are three nominations:
  "Annette's Office" by /Matt, the Sydney gathering one by Annette, and the
  Melbourne gathering one by Andy Butt... And the winner is:
  
  "Annette's Office", of which a portion is printed here for your enjoyment:
  
  One word... "strange".
  
  Many words to follow.
  
  "Annette's Office" by /Matt
  
  My first impression was that Disney had invaded this fine burrough of
  productivity, but alas it's just Maxwell's rather peculiar obsession with
  the Lion King. Apparently the story is people working in this biulding
  aren't supposed to stick posters or post stickers on the windows, but
  Annette (a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away) confronted the powers
  that be and openly defied them by sticking little yellow Disneyfied lions
  on it. The powers that be did nothing to punish this post-modern Prometheus
  (there's a double reference for you, anybody to get both gets a prize.
  Email Annette for more details), a rebellion erupted, the incumbent rulers
  were overthrown and Annette was declared the new ruler...
  
  **The HRH for the most cringe-worthy pun since the last report goes to...
  guess who?... Intensity - for this little gem:
  
  >> >>Maybe it was some *other* goth girl carrying a stuffed peacock through
  >> >>Melbourne's CBD?
  >>
  >> >Shirley Maclane?
  >>
  >> But it was in Melbourne, so wouldn't that make it *Holly* Maclane?  ;o)
  
  >Ooooohhhhh... That's stretching it a bit! <g>
  
  Sure.  And anyway, you'd have to be a Die Hard regular of this newsgroup
  to get the joke.
  
  **Steve Leahy gets the HRH for inspiring the most exciting visuals (in my
  mind at least) with this comment (in response to Annette):
  
  Annette Fraser wrote:
  
  > He needed a good whack on the nose with a rolled up newspaper :-).
  
  Welcome to the FBI training academy...
  
  Mulder! Sit! Down!  Stay! No! Did I tell you you could move? Get
  back over here this instant...
  :-)
  
  **The HRH for the most disparaging, while also managing to keep the rest
  of us in stitches, post goes to Matt-5 for his entire response to the
  "How to make $5 to $5,000 $$$$" thread. An excerpt only is shown:
  
   Sorry, gotta comment.

   Or in case you suddenly come to your senses.
  
  **The HRH for yet another brilliant description of what atxf is *really*
  all about goes to Marcus. He also gets a mini-HRH for the great snipping
  line contained herein:
  
  <list of Canberrans brutally chopped>

  We'll take this as your delurking message and hence from now on, you
  *must* post minimum of 10 messages per week. Failing to do so will
  incurr severe penalty. (ie. You will be tied to David Duchovny and
  smeared with Choc-sauce(TM) and then thrown among a Bunch of Lyndals &

  **There were a number of competitors for the following HRH: the best
  elaboration of what those letters Steve Leahy referred to in his FAQ

  To Daniel Frankham for this one:

  The Aliens Designed Ancient Monuments and Diverse Other Delusions
  Device
  
  And to Steve Turtle, Michael Aulfrey and someone else (sorry, the names

  >Total World Integration Technology?
  
  No sorry, in this case it's

  Steve T.
  
  **And last, but not least, the HRH for most tenacious delurk of the week
  - otherwise known as seeing one word of interest and throttling it for
  all it's worth - goes to he who goes by the name OXALIAN:
  
  I love pinball sooo much,
  
  I would barely be able to contain myself if there was an X-files pinball.
  It needs to be really exciting and with heaps to do.
  
  The best machines I have played have been - Theatre of Magic (?) and Johnny
  Mneumonic (Williams).  These are notable machines.
  
  I read stuff from this group alot and see a huge amount of crazy stuff, and
  theories named Frank...but never have too much to say 'cept now.
  
  ===================================
  
  Holly looked up and smiled. "Well, that's it. My duty's done."
  
  With that she turned around and left the room. Behind her, the group
  slowly began to disperse. Gillian looked around in confusion as everyone
  hurriedly left the room, ignoring her in their eagerness to return home
  and dissect the latest two-parter on the net. The room was empty within a
  matter of minutes and Gillian slowly stood up, preparing to take her
  leave. A soft noise crept up on her, and she turned back and faced the
  now-empty room. She moved forward slightly and peered into the gloom,
  suddenly convinced that there was someone left. She heard a tiny murmur
  and headed towards it.
  
  There, asleep in a corner was the person she had been come to know as
  The Oracle. She knelt down beside him and gently shook his shoulder. He
  awakened slowly, drifting out of one dream state, into what he thought
  was another. Gillian smiled down at him kindly, and The Oracle smiled in
  return. Questions appeared in her head without rhyme or reason, and she
  asked them of him:
  
  ~1. What is your age?
  I sent myself this message for the atxf birthday database:
  Nathan Jones (The Oracle) 2nd June 1977 (19 yrs.)
  
  ~2. What was your first X-Files episode?
  The pilot.
  
  ~3. What are your favourite episodes and why?
  Eve, The Calusari & Conduit, because of creepy Joel Palmer & the
  Krievins twins. Anything by Darin Morgan. Fire. Several others.
  
  ~4. What is your least favourite episode and why?
  Fearful Symmetry. Well, look at it - it's a joke! Plus I got it on
  tape and consequently missed out on taping Fire.
  
  ~5. Why do you like The X-Files?
  This is really a silly question to ask an X-Phile. The sheer effort
  they put into each episode makes it what it is. I partly like the show
  because of it's cult status - I can talk to others about it, and I
  find that you can relate anything to The X-Files.
  
  ~6. What computer do you use?
  486 with little memory, but enough to frequently connect to Unix @ RMIT.
  
  ~7. If you were Mulder and you found Scully naked, tied up and smeared
  ~with chocolate sauce you would:
  Quickly untie her, then offer to help her clean up.  ;-)
  
  ~8. Marital status?
  I think marriage is a good idea, as long as you find the right person.
  Oh, BTW, I'm single.
  
  ~9. Desperation status?
  Interested & looking, but not desperate. <g>
  
  ~9a) Are you glad you shared that dream with us?
  Oh, absolutely. I am currently trying various sleep potions, so I come
  come up with more provocative dreams. :)
  
  ~9b) If you found Lyndal naked, tied up and smeared with chocolate
  ~topping you would:
  Did I tell you that I am related to Carl Wade? No? Okay, so locking
  Lyndal in an oubliette would not go down too well. I think I would ask
  Lyndal if she got herself into this predicament, then help her get
  cleaned up accordingly...
  
  ~9c) How do you *really* feel about Lyndal?
  I like having someone who shares my prurient mind <gfL>. With Lyndal being
  the way she is, I can vicariously live a childhood and a more adult life
  at the same time.
  
  ~9d) How do you *really* feel about muffins?
  If I'm at Mornington on a Monday morning and don't have to rush into
  Uni., I have hot chocolate and a muffin with Mum before leaving. So, I
  have always liked muffins (esp. chocolate, blueberry). I am a little
  concerned that muffin eating may develop a sexual connotation, and
  maybe some newsgroup rivalry, though.
  
  ~10) Other must-see shows?
  ER, Seinfeld, Media Watch. I used to watch more TV, but I spent VCE
  in my room, pretending to do homework, so now I listen to music.
  
  ~11) What TV shows should be brought back?
  Shows come and go, I'm not too concerned. Wait! No! I almost forgot -
  The Late Show. I am still mourning the death of The Late Show. :-(
  
  ~12) What TV shows should be euthanased immediately?
  Any show involving bimbo blondes. Neighbours, so I can put Seinfeld on
  without living in fear of the theme song preceeding it.
  
  ~13) If you were Scully and you found Mulder naked, you would:
  <With a look of disgust, but not at all surprised:>
  "No wonder you're in the basement Mulder! You could at least warn
  me before you open your copy of Private magazine."
  <Turning to Frohike, who has the remote control in one hand, and...>
  "Lay a hand on me and you'll have a life of suffering to regret it."
  
  ~14) How long have you been on the net?
  Forever. Actually, 18 months on an almost daily basis.
  
  ~15) Are you happy now?
  Just at the moment, I'm feeling a little bit low, melancholy even.
  That time of the month, I guess. Yet, by the time you post this, who
  knows? This is a silly question to ask, since moods change constantly. [3]
  
  "Good" Gillian replied, and then they both stood up and left the room.
  
  THE END
  
  [3] A prize of some sort goes to the person who correctly guesses which
  question Orrie added in himself. :)
