  <h1>The Transmaniacon Report - 19 April 1996 </h1>
  
  <b>by Matt Treyvaud</b>
  <pre>
  THE TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL OFFICIAL ERISTIC TRANSMANIACON REPORT
  
  or
  
  SHUDDERERS
  ----------
  
  (In a Townsville living room...)
  
  'Well,' Intensity said. 'I'm very pleased about the second 
  Townsville Gathering. Particularly the turnout. Why, it looks 
  like there are twice as many people here as there were at the 
  first!'
          'There are,' Matt-5, the only other person in the room, 
  said.
          Crickets chirped.
          'So anyway,' Matt-5 went on, 'What were you going to 
  show me?'
          'Ah!' Intensity said, eyes lighting up. 'That!'
          'Is it?'
          'What?'
          ' "That." '
          'Oh, that. Yes. It's "that".'
          Matt-5 scratched his head. 'What were we talking about 
  again?'
          'Come with me,' Intensity said, 'And I'll show you.' He 
  led the way to a bookshelf in the corner of the TV room, and 
  laid his hand upon one of the books thereon: a self-help book by 
  Ken Kesey, entitled 'How To Get What You REALLY REALLY REALLY 
  Want.'
          'Behold,' Intensity said, applying pressure to the top 
  of the book. 'My laboratory!'
          The bookshelf swung inward to reveal a small cupboard 
  filled with bedding. 
          'No, wait, that's the linen closet,' Intensity said, 
  and walked across to another bookshelf where he pulled down on 
  'The NNAS Manifesto' (by M. F. Luder). That bookshelf too swung 
  inward, revealing a small cramped room lit by a single naked 
  light bulb. In the harsh glow of the bulb, Matt-5 observed a 
  large wooden table upon which was scattered a wide assortment of 
  electrical bits and pieces - but, most interestingly, one small 
  device shaped rather like a remote control.
          'Egad,' Matt-5 said. 'Don't tell me you've developed 
  some sort of trans-dimensional warp, which will allow us to 
  explore an infinity of parallel universes?'
          Intensity frowned a puzzled frown. 'I don't think so,' 
  he replied.
          'No. Of course you haven't. Damn foolishness to ask, 
  really,' Matt-5 said.
          'No,' Intensity said, getting back into his stride. 
  'What you see before you is nothing less than the Ultimate In 
  Shuddering Technology!'
          Matt-5 gasped. 'But that's been the dream of 
  theoretical physics for decades!' he cried. 'Do you mean to tell 
  me that you, an unknown, unpublished, blah blah blah, have 
  solved the problem?'
          'Yes!' Intensity said, eyes blazing with passion. 'I 
  have invented... Shudder/2 Warp!'
          Lightning crashed outside (either that or the roof fell 
  off).
          'Beta test version,' Intensity admitted in a more 
  normal tone of voice.
          'Is it safe?' Matt-5 asked.
          'I don't know,' Intensity replied with an honesty Matt-
  5 found entirely unnecessary. 'But there's only one way to find 
  out.'
          'Controlled experiments in a laboratory environment, 
  upon inanimate objects?' Matt-5 suggested hopefully.
          'No,' Intensity said. 'Dangerously uncontrolled 
  experiments upon myself.'
          'What do you need me for?' Matt-5 asked.
          'The plot,' Intensity replied. 'Now let's try it out.' 
  He reached out and grabbed the device.
          There was a brief pause.
          'Let's... shudder!' Intensity cried, and pressed a 
  large red button.
          Nothing shuddered. However, a large wobbly transparent 
  donut-like thing did appear in mid-air, over the table.
          'I knew it,' Matt-5 moaned.
          'So did I,' Gene said.
          Then Intensity and Matt-5 were sucked into the pan-
  dimensional donut and vanished from their Earth.
  
  'Aaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!' Matt-5 screamed as he fell out of the donut 
  into a pleasant little park.
          'Yeeeeeeeeeeha!' shouted Intensity, as he did the same.
          'I should have known,' Matt-5 grumbled, dusting himself 
  off. 
          'I think it needs some more R & D,' Intensity said 
  cheerfully. 'But I'm confident it can be fixed. And if it can't, 
  we'll just start selling it as a device for travelling between 
  universes. Do you suppose there's a big market for that?'
          Matt-5 didn't reply. 'Look over there,' he said, 
  pointing.
          Intensity looked over where Matt-5 was pointing. There, 
  trudging through the park, was a small group of men - 7 in all - 
  chained together and walking in step. Each was wearing a 
  skintight latex suit, not entirely unlike that donned by Bruce 
  Willis in 'Twelve Monkeys' - and they were -all bald-.
          'There's something funny about them,' Intensity mused. 
  'But I can't quite -'
          'Silence!' a voice from behind them cried, making them 
  both jump. They spun, to see a familiar figure behind them - 
  Annette Fraser, wearing a strange black leather uniform and a 
  peaked cap.
          'Hey Annette,' Intensity said casually.
          'Hey,' Matt-5 said, raising one hand and adding nothing 
  to the intellectual content of the conversation. 'Nice threads.'
          'Be silent, dogs!' Annette shouted. 'Where are your 
  assigned clothes?'
          'Assigned clothes?' Matt-5 repeated, confused.
          'When did you last shave?' demanded Annette.
          Intensity rubbed his chin. 'Only this morning,' he 
  said. 'It can't be -'
          'Not your chins!' Annette exclaimed. 'Your -heads-!'
          'Annette, what are you talking about?' Intensity asked. 
  'It's me, Intensity. I mean, Andrew. And you remember Matt - 
  he's the one who likes The Naked Truth.'
          Annette recoiled in disgust. 'The Naked Truth? Oh, this 
  is too much! You must be rehabilitated!' And, so saying, clubbed 
  them both about the head with her nightstick.
          'Gaah! Gaaaah!' Matt-5 and Intensity said, as they 
  collapsed, unconscious.
  
  When they woke they found themselves in a dank dungeon, chained 
  to a wall. They were both wearing skintight latex suits, just as 
  the other men in the park had been, and they both had oddly cold 
  heads. Looking at each other they realised it was probably due 
  to the fact that they had been embaldened.
          'I hope it wasn't -you- who put me into this thing,' 
  Matt-5 said, looking down.
          'So do I,' Intensity replied.
          'Ah,' a voice they both recognised as Annete's said. 
  They looked up to see (unsurprisingly) Annette. 'You're awake,' 
  she went on. 'That's good. -SHE- likes them awake.'
          Somewhat worried by the way Annette had pronounced '-
  SHE-', Matt-5 said, 'Er... she does?'
          'Not only that,' Annette said, apparently ignoring him, 
  'But -SHE- has taken a special interest in you two. Oh yes... a 
  very special interest indeed.' She laughed an evil laugh 
  formerly only the province of the end of the Michael Jackson 
  song, 'Thriller'.
          'Is that good?' asked Intensity.
          Annette paused in mid-laugh. 'It depends,' she said. 
  'How do you feel about kinkiness in general?'
          Matt-5 brightened. 'Well, actually,' he began. 'I -'
          'I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding,' Intensity 
  said, cutting him off. 'You see, we aren't from this Earth.'
          'Oh,' Annette said. 'Are you another lot who've 
  developed a sort of trans-dimensional warp, which allows you to 
  explore an infinity of parallel universes?'
          Intensity nodded. 'So you see,' he said, 'I really 
  think we'd do better to -'
          From outside, trumpets began to blare. And they blared 
  'You Oughta Know'.
          'Ah!' Annette said, grinning evilly. 'That'll be -HER- 
  now.'
          There was an uncomfortable pause for twenty-three 
  seconds, due to bad scripting, before a door flew open and a 
  familiar figure walked into the dungeon. Dressed in her official 
  Report Uniform of leather catsuit and wielding her trademark 
  whip, there was no mistaking who -SHE- was.
          'Lyndal!' Intensity and Matt-5 cried out as one 
  (harmonising quite nicely).
          'Rotflm!' Lyndal cried. 'Yes, it is I! Queen of the 
  USA! Undisputed master of the entire world! In this universe, 
  anyway.'
          'Gasp!' Intensity said.
          'Gasp!' Matt-5 added.
          'You may leave,' Lyndal said to Annette. 'I wish to be 
  alone with these two.'
          Annette complied. Lyndal turned again to face the 
  hapless two.
          '<wg>!' she said, taking her vocal organs to new 
  extremes. 'So, you thought to traverse Elizondo Park without 
  your official uniform?'
          'We didn't have uniforms,' Matt-5 said. 'We're from a 
  parallel universe.'
          'Ha! And I suppose those haircuts are customary in that 
  universe, too!'
          Matt-5 and Intensity looked at each other. 'Actually, 
  no,' Intensity admitted.
          'No matter,' Lyndal said. 'For your crimes you will 
  be.... disciplined. But first, you will explain to me this 
  device,' she added, pulling the Shudder/2 Warp out of her back 
  pocket. 'I find it intriguing. Does it spray some sort of 
  condiment or sweetening?'
          'No,' Intensity said. 'It allows you to traverse the 
  Einstein-Rosen-Podolvky bridge and visit parallel dimensions.'
          Lyndal looked at him skeptically. 'Am I to believe that 
  you, an unknown, unkempt, blah blah blah, have achieved what my 
  best scientists could not?'
          'Well, yes,' Intensity said.
          'Well, I don't,' Lyndal replied. 'And thus I therefore 
  conclude that it must be some sort of disciplinary device, the 
  true meaning of which you seek to conceal from me.'
          'Who are you, Br'er Fox?' Matt-5 asked, because he 
  hadn't had a line for a while.
          Lyndal looked at him with an unsettling grin. 
  'Sometimes,' she said. The two minds of Intensity and Matt-5 
  raced.
          'Now!' she went on. 'It is time, I believe, to use this 
  device on you!'
          So saying, she pressed the red button and the compter-
  generated transparent wobbly donut flew out of the end.
          '-Very- impressive!' she said.
          Due to a plot hole, Intensity and Matt-5 were sucked 
  free of their manacles and down into the wormhole, which then 
  vanished.
          Lyndal's subsequent wrath and the results thereof 
  cannot be gone into here (due to the weak stomach of the 
  narrator); suffice it to say that [deleted by moderator].
  
  'Aaargh!' Matt-5 said, tumbling out onto the grass in the park.
          'Aaaaa-o!' Intensity cried, tumbling out onto Matt-5 on 
  the grass in the park.
          'I don't suppose you thought to grab the Shudder/2 
  before you were dragged in?' Intensity asked, when he'd caught 
  his breath.
          'I'm afraid not,' Matt-5 replied in a muffled tone of 
  voice.
          'Let's just hope we're in a good universe then,' 
  Intensity said, in a grim macho sort of way.
          'I liked the last one,' Matt-5 muttered to himself as 
  they got up.
          'Well, it doesn't look too bad,' Intensity said, 
  surveying the park. 'No-one's dressed in latex.'
          Matt-5 refrained from commenting.
          'It's just,' Intensity finished, 'That everyone seems a 
  little...'
          'Short?' Matt-5 suggested.
          'Yes,' Intensity agreed. 'Short. Not that there's 
  anything wrong with that.'
          A small group of people (or, to put it another way, a 
  group of small people) wandering down the park path noticed 
  them. One of the group nudged the person next to him and said, 
  '*High* there, you two!'
          The rest of the group burst out laughing.
          'You ought to stand closer to the path,' one of the 
  others said, wiping tears from his eyes. 'We almost... 
  *over*looked you!'
          Intensity and Matt-5 looked at each other.
          'It could be worse,' Intensity said.
          'What's the matter?' the man who'd first spoken asked 
  them. 'Don't you want to... *tall*k to us?'
          'I really would have thought,' Matt-5 said sternly, 
  'That you people would have been above that sort of humour.'
          Too late, he realised his inadvertent Tall Joke, and 
  the group rolled on the ground laughing.
          'Mister,' one of them said, 'You're allllllllllll 
  right.'
          'Why don't you two come with us?' another asked. 'We're 
  going to an awards ceremony.'
          Intensity cringed at the weakness of the link, but 
  still managed to deliver his line: 'Shrug,' he said. 'Come on, 
  let's go.'
          And so Intensity, Matt-5, and a whole bunch of short 
  people walked off to the Tattoo Memorial Convention Hall to 
  witness the TWENTY-THIRD ERISTIC TRANSMANIACON AWARDS.
  
  The MC, dressed in a hand-me-down from Andrew Denton, cwaeth

  'The IN THEE Transmaniacon for Best Non-ATXF-Based X-Files Service
  goes to whoever it was at Rage who decided to play the X-Files theme
  - the whole thing, as heard on the end of the Unanswered File -
  at about 1:08 a.m. Saturday morning. Even though there was a spoiler
  or two in the video clip.
  
  At that moment, Matt-5, in the middle of applauding, suddenly 
  heard a voice in his head:
          'Do not be alarmed [it said]. We are a race of 
  hyperintelligent beings from the planet Sirius.'
          'Sirius isn't a planet,' Matt-5 thought.
          'That's what -you- think,' the hyperintelligent beings 
  replied smugly. 'At any rate, we have information which could 
  well catapault mankind into the Age of Aquarius with a minimum 
  of suffering. Unfortunately for you, we're not going to send it. 
  Instead, here's an interview with our emissary on earth, Holly 
  Alexander...
  
  > 1.   What is your age?
  
  Let's clear this up, shall we? I'm twenty-one!! I may look twelve, but 
  I'm twenty-one alright?? <g>
   
  > 1a.  Are you sure it's not 12?
  
  Yes. Although I can see how Steven could make such a mistake - I mean, 21 
  and 12: they're not *that* different. :)
  
  > 2.   What was your first X-Files episode?
  
  Eve.
   
  > 3.   What is your favourite X-Files episode? Why? 
  
  Oooohhh... do I have to choose?? OK, I'll go with the one that first 
  moved me to tears, "Irresistible". There are others that I've seen since 
  then that would also count as my favourites, but that one just gets to me 
  everytime... When Scully's at the psychiatrist's and says "I know these 
  things"... I just die every time I see that.
  
  Gillian is God! :)

  Space, Space, Space... Lousy acting on the part of the guest actors. 
  Shocking script, stupid characterisation of Mulder.... Is that enough? 
  It's only redeeming feature is seeing Scully actually *grinning* at the end!
  
  > 5.   Why do you like The X-Files?
  
  OK, I'll try and keep this short. Because it allows me to consider the 
  realm of extreme possibilities without needing to believe, or disbelieve 
  it. Because it has the guts to have two attractive lead characters who 
  aren't sleeping together (and therefore leaves *so* much scope for the 
  fanfic writers!), because the writing, the characters, the direction, the 
  music are the best any TV show has ever done in my memory. (Although Twin 
  Peaks runs a close second). But most of all because it keeps me coming 
  back every week for more.
  
  And I love the show because it has a strong female character - who I 
  admire and, yes, I'm not ashamed to admit it - look up to!! :p
  
  > 6.   What computer do you use?
  
  Apple Mac Powerbook 160.

  Skinner??? Well, I'd imagine he'd keep him tied up until he revealed all 
  about CM and his cohorts... ;)
   
  > 8.   Marital status?
  
  Haven't tried that one yet.
  
  > 9.   Desperation status?
  
  No comment. <g>
  
  > 10.  Other must-see shows?
  
  When I get a chance (ie: when I'm not glued to the net...): ER, Mad About 
  You, NYPD Blue, The Simpsons... all the usual suspects, basically. :)
  
  > 11.  What TV shows should they bring back?
  
  They already did: The Brady Bunch! :) (Otherwise, Little House on the 
  Prarie).
   
  > 12.  What TV shows should be euthanased immediately?
  
  A Current Affair.
  
  > 13.  If you were Scully and you found Mulder naked you would:
  
  Hmm... Let's see now...
  
  "Scully allowed her eyes to rake up and down Mulder's taut, chocolate 
  covered torso. Although her face remained steely-faced, it was her eyes 
  that reflected her true feelings at seeing her partner in such a 
  vulnerable, yet desirable position. She stepped forward slowly, keeping 
  her pale blue eyes focused on him steadily... She was only a few inches 
  away from him now, and she languidly reached up and undid the cords which 
  bound him so cruelly.
  
  'Mulder, are you alright?'..."
  
  I think I can feel my next fanfic coming on... :)
  
  > 13a. Didn't we already do this sort of question?
  
  But it so much fun to explore extreme possibilities! <g>
  
  > 13b. All right then. If you were Mulder and you found a plastic bag

  Pass it to Scully - we know she likes chocolate. :) (After seeing a 
  certain ep which I won't mention b/c it's a spoiler.)
  
  > 14.  How long have you been on the net?
  
  Five months exactly.
   
  > 14a. Gee, aren't you getting tired by now?
  
  Yes. I think I'll go to work now... :)
